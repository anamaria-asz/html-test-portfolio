<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Ana Maria, a biomedical engineer from Colombia. I did my bachelor studies at Nueva Granada Military University where got my 
  degree with honors, cum laude.
  Some of my hobbies include swimming, yoga and watching movies, and the classic ones, hanging out with my friends my
  cute boyfriend and listening to music.

<p>
  My professional interests include neurorrehabilitation, neuroscience and as you may know, programming, learned the first ones from college 
  but fullstack has been more of a personal path to me. I believe technologies and apps are a strong tool to help in medicine improving therapies
  and giving new accesible and fast diagnoses.
