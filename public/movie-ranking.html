<hr />
<h3>Little Women</h3>
<p>It feels it was made with love, if you're into classic literature and love the book you are gonna adore this version</p>
<h3>Mad Max</h3>
<p>A good plot, lots of action and well-written characteres, what else could you ask for</p>
<h3>La la land</h3>
<p>Love and passion at its maximum. And yes, it is a musical</p>
